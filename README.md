# Twilio Project - Takeaway

This is the Twilio Project finished, including a working interface that makes use of all the classes together.

Simply run _interface.py_ in the **interface** directory.

Customer instance and details as well as food items can be modified/added within the _interface.py_ file.

_P.S: The SMS class features a logfile method that will create a text file in the project's directory._
